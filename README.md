# Buenos Aires
This WebGIS presents tree-level analysis of a 7.3 ha palm plantation in Buenos Aires, Argentina. A total of 4,728 trees were detected from 4.5 cm UAV multispectral imagery using a custom-trained YOLO11s model. Per-tree NDVI and NDRE values were calculated from the orthomosaic to assess canopy health and spatial variability across two plantation blocks.
